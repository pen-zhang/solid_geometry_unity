This project is based on Unity and Vuforia. Students can freely rotate the models, adjust the parameters ( radius, edge, height and so on) of 4 solid geometry (cube, sphere, cone, cylinder) to observe the change and view the animation of demonstrating the surface of a cube. Also, students can use a free-falling module to learn about the influence of mass and gravity to the falling process.
