This project is based on Unity (C#) and Vuforia. This application can recognize different image-target and present corresponding geometry model to enrich the students’ textbook. Users can rotate the models by moving mouse and adjust the models’ property (radius, edges) by slider and toggle in UI. By invoking the physics module of Unity, users can input different digits to modify the gravity of the environment when observing the free-falling.
